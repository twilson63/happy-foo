An app that tracks users happiness

This is a practice application to create an app that empowers the user to track and trend their happiness on the interval they choose. it is a mobile application with a cloud storage database and a analytical dashboard. The user can use the app anonymously and record their happiness or mood:

* Estatic
* Happy
* Ok
* Blah
* Sad
* Depressed

The app will track and trend the information and show the results for the user based on the other user base for that day and the last two weeks.

I full web reporting dashboard will built and will be available for others to look at the aggregate results of the users happyness. We will use the device gps to get the users location when they document their mood, so we can show a dashboard of the mood of users around the globe.

This will be a great app to play with localization i18N and implement a solution in several different languages.

When each mood is recorded it would be nice to show a random cat picture and an inspirational quote.
